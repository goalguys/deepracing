Autonomously learning to race autonomously



Doxygen-style documentation is in-work. :)

All of the track data in data-logger/tracks is from [Iko Rein's telemetry tool](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/telemetry-tool-for-f1-22.52172/). Huge thanks for all of the effort it took to create those.
